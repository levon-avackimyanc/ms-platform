# Smart Build

Build with **semantic context routing** - loads only the sections you need.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Plan (if argument is a plan file)

If `$ARGUMENTS` ends with `.md` and the file exists in `specs/`, this is a **plan execution** request. The plan has already been reviewed by plan-reviewer during `/dev_plan`. Read the plan and execute tasks directly (skip Steps 1-3 for context routing — use the plan's Stack keywords instead).

**OpenSpec tracking init:** At the start of plan execution, check if an OpenSpec change exists:
```bash
openspec list --changes --json 2>/dev/null
```
Look for a change matching the plan filename (kebab-case). If found, note the change name — you will update its `tasks.md` incrementally as the Dev scope agents (developer / unit-tester / code-reviewer) complete tasks (see Step 4).

### Step 1: Route Task to Sections

Run the deterministic context router (keyword matching, zero LLM cost).

When executing a plan, prepend the task's `**Stack**` field to the task description for accurate routing:

```bash
# Direct task — use as-is
echo '$ARGUMENTS' | uv run --script .claude/hooks/context_router.py

# Plan task — prepend Stack keywords for reliable routing
echo 'Stack: Java Spring Boot JPA. Task: Add @ConfigurationProperties for payment gateway' | \
  uv run --script .claude/hooks/context_router.py
```

The router returns JSON like:
```json
{
  "sections": ["java-patterns#basics", "java-testing#integration"],
  "reasoning": "Matched: java, endpoint, error"
}
```

### Step 2: Load Sections

Pipe the router output to the section loader:

```bash
echo '$ARGUMENTS' | uv run --script .claude/hooks/context_router.py | \
  uv run --script .claude/hooks/section_loader.py
```

Or in two steps if you need to inspect the routing:
```bash
ROUTE=$(echo '$ARGUMENTS' | uv run --script .claude/hooks/context_router.py)
echo "$ROUTE"  # inspect routing decision
echo "$ROUTE" | uv run --script .claude/hooks/section_loader.py
```

### Step 3: Execute with Focused Context

Now you have only the relevant reference sections loaded.

Use this context to implement the task following the patterns.

**You (the orchestrator) own the task ledger.** The Dev scope sub-agents
(`developer` / `unit-tester` / `code-reviewer` / `validator`) have **no Task tools**
— they cannot call `TaskUpdate`/`TaskGet`, so they receive their tasks via the
prompt and report what they did in their **Report**. After each agent returns, *you*
update the shared task status (and the OpenSpec `tasks.md` in Step 4) from that
Report. Do not assume an agent updated its own status. If an agent "comes to rest"
mid-task (partial output), inspect the files on disk to determine actual completion
before deploying a continuation — continuations are fresh agents (no `SendMessage`
context), so they must rely on on-disk artifacts plus a precise prompt.

### Step 4: Track OpenSpec Progress (if available)

This step runs **incrementally throughout plan execution**, not as a batch at the end.

**After each agent (developer / unit-tester / code-reviewer) completes a task:**
1. Find the matching task in `openspec/changes/<change-name>/tasks.md` by task name or description
2. Mark its checkbox as `[x]` immediately using Edit tool
3. This enables real-time progress tracking via `openspec view`

**After ALL tasks are complete — final report:**
```
OpenSpec Change Updated: openspec/changes/<change-name>/tasks.md
Completed: X/Y tasks

Next steps:
- Run `/openspec-apply-change` to merge delta specs into the main service spec
- Run `/openspec-archive-change` to finalize and archive the change
```

If no OpenSpec change was found in Step 0, skip this step silently.

### Step 4.5: Verify Test Layer Realism (post-build)

Run **once** after the `unit-tests` task completes and before the `code-review` / `validate-all` tasks. Confirms that what the team actually built matches the plan's `## Test Infrastructure (User-Declared)` contract. In a Dev plan the only non-Skipped layer is the **Unit Layer** (Integration/E2E are marked `Skipped — owned by Test scope`); the hook is generic and simply checks whatever layers are non-Skipped:

- For each non-Skipped layer block: `Files glob` resolves to ≥1 file; `Infra signature` regex matches in every resolved file (skipped when `n/a`, as is typical for unit); each declared `Happy-path scenario` has a corresponding test (fuzzy grep on the last identifier-like token).
- Anti-mock heuristic on integration files (WARN-only): high mock density vs. declared scenarios — a no-op for Dev plans, which declare no live integration layer.

Skip this step if executing a direct task (no plan file).

```bash
uv run --script .claude/hooks/validators/check_test_layers.py --plan <plan-path>
```

**Interpreting the result:**
- **PASS** → declared layers all match what was built. Done.
- **FAIL** → either the `unit-tests` task did not produce the expected files, the declared infra is not actually used, or scenario method names drifted from the plan. Address before `code-review`/`validate-all`: re-run the `unit-tester`, rename test methods to match scenarios, or amend the plan if the implementation made a justified deviation.

The hook is generic — it does not know about specific testing libraries. It only verifies what the plan declared. New libraries or stacks need no code change here; just describe them in the plan.

### Step 5: Verify Surgical Scope (final check)

Run **once** after all dev/test tasks complete (and after the validator agent's stack checks). Compares actual git changes against the plan's declared `## Relevant Files` + `### New Files` to catch unrelated edits, "while-we're-here" refactors, and scope creep.

Skip this step if executing a direct task (no plan file).

```bash
uv run --script .claude/hooks/validators/check_diff_scope.py --plan <plan-path>
```

Optional: pass `--baseline <ref>` (e.g. `main`, branch point) to also include committed changes since that ref. Without `--baseline`, only the working tree + index are inspected (cheaper, suits a single-session run).

**Interpreting the result:**
- **PASS** → all changes trace back to declared scope. Done.
- **FAIL** → out-of-scope files listed. For each one, ask: was it a necessary discovery (add it to the plan retroactively + note why) or scope creep (revert)? Do not silently accept.

This is advisory — the script exits 1 on FAIL but does not block. The decision to revert vs. amend the plan stays with you.

## Example

**Task:** "Добавь endpoint /users с тестами"

1. Router returns:
   ```json
   {
     "sections": ["java-patterns#basics", "java-patterns#errors", "java-testing#structure", "java-testing#http"],
     "reasoning": "REST endpoint needs code standards, error handling, and HTTP test patterns"
   }
   ```

2. Loader provides ~8k tokens instead of ~20k

3. You implement with focused, relevant patterns only

## Token Savings

| Approach | Tokens |
|----------|--------|
| Universal (all refs) | ~20,000 |
| Smart routing (avg) | ~5,000 |
| **Savings** | **75%** |
