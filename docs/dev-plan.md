# Dev Plan

`/dev_plan` generates implementation plans for multi-agent execution. It analyzes requirements, interviews the user, reads the codebase, and produces a spec document that `/smart_build` can execute with a team of builder agents.

## Two-Round Requirements Interview

The planner asks clarifying questions when it detects ambiguities — not about everything, but about every point where two or more valid interpretations exist or where the prompt is underspecified.

The two rounds are separated by codebase reading — this injects new information between rounds and keeps each round focused on what's knowable at that stage.

### Round 1: After Analyzing Requirements + OpenSpec Explore

Questions about ambiguities in the user's request — before reading any code. If OpenSpec findings exist from Step 2, they inform the questions. Ask when:

- **Contradiction detected** — the prompt implies two mutually exclusive approaches
- **Underspecified behavior** — key user states (unauthorized, empty data, error) are not described
- **Multiple valid approaches** — present both with pros/cons, let user choose
- **Design/UX choices** — placement, copy, interaction details that are matters of taste
- **Scope ambiguity** — unclear whether adjacent features are in or out of scope
- **Spec conflict** — OpenSpec findings reveal overlap or contradiction with existing living requirements

### Round 2: After Reading the Codebase

Questions about implementation choices visible from the code. Ask when:

- **Multiple patterns exist** — codebase has more than one way to solve this type of problem
- **Technical tradeoff with no clear winner** — both options valid, depends on unstated priorities
- **Integration ambiguity** — new feature fits in more than one place or way
- **Discovered edge case** — reading the code revealed a scenario the prompt didn't address

Skip a round entirely if every choice has a single obvious answer.

### Why Two Rounds, Not More

Research on multi-turn LLM interactions shows a consistent pattern: large gains in early interactions, diminishing returns by turns 3-5, and risk of degradation beyond that.

- **TiCoder** (Microsoft, ICSE 2024): m=1 gives +19pp, m=2 gives +7pp, m=3 gives +2pp. Plateau after 3 interactions.
- **LLMs Get Lost in Multi-Turn Conversation** (Microsoft, 2025): 39% average performance degradation in multi-turn vs single-turn across all models tested. Consolidating information into fewer, richer turns outperforms distributing across many.
- **Another Turn, Better Output?** (NeurIPS 2025): targeted feedback ("denormalized counter vs COUNT query?") sustains improvement; vague feedback ("anything else?") plateaus or reverses quality.
- **Information Gain per Turn** (NeurIPS 2025): information gain decays per turn without injection of new external data — which is why Round 2 works: reading the codebase between rounds injects new information.

Two rounds with new information between them is the sweet spot: enough to resolve ambiguities, short enough to avoid context degradation.

## Section Routing Catalog

Every task in a plan has a `**Stack**` field — keywords that tell the [context router](context-routing.md) which coding standards to load for the builder.

The planner picks keywords from a catalog embedded in its prompt:

| Section | Trigger keywords | Add when task involves |

The Stack field combines stack keywords (selects the stack) with section keywords (selects specific sections):

```
Stack: "Java Spring Boot controller exception error handling"
         ↓ stack keywords            ↓ section keywords
     java-patterns#basics      java-patterns#errors
```

## Plan Review (Step 12)

After saving the plan, `/dev_plan` runs a two-stage review gate before proceeding to OpenSpec propose. See [Plan Review](plan-review.md) for details on the 8 criteria.

## Stack Validation (Check 7)

The plan validator runs Check 7 on every task — imports `context_router.route()` and verifies the Stack field produces sections:

```python
result = route_fn(stack)
if not result.get("sections"):
    errors.append(f"Stack doesn't match any routing keywords")
```

Two failure modes caught:
- **Missing Stack** — task has no `**Stack**` field at all
- **Dead keywords** — Stack contains words that don't trigger any section

A plan with broken routing is rejected at validation, not discovered during build.

## Plan Format

The generated plan includes these sections:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Task Description | What needs to be done |
| Objective | What "done" looks like |
| Problem Statement | Why this work is needed *(medium/complex tasks)* |
| Solution Approach | How the objective will be achieved *(medium/complex tasks)* |
| Relevant Files | Existing files to modify + new files to create |
| Implementation Phases | Foundation → Core → Integration *(medium/complex tasks)* |
| Team Orchestration | Team members with roles and agent types |
| Step by Step Tasks | Ordered tasks with IDs, dependencies, Stack, assignments |
| Acceptance Criteria | Measurable completion conditions |
| Validation Commands | Shell commands to verify the work |
