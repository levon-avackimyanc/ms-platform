> Personal fork of [disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery](https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery) — a multi-agent framework for **Java**, **React/TypeScript**, and **Python** projects built on Claude Code hooks.

## Goal

Make Claude Code agent work **independently and consistently** — you describe a task, Claude Code delivers a quality result that matches your expectations.

### Principles

1. **Automate every action** — if an action exists, it's automated via LLM (planning, review, validation, knowledge recording)
2. **Control via deterministic scripts** — all actions are governed by hard scripts, not LLM discretion (validators, routers, dispatchers)
3. **Never delete files** — destructive operations are prohibited; hooks enforce this at the system level
4. **Document into project memory** — decisions and outcomes are recorded into long-term project-level memory (Serena, OpenSpec)
5. **Strict format validation** — plan structure and documentation format are verified by structural validators before execution
6. **Stack-aware coding standards** — code and test conventions are loaded into agents dynamically by scripts based on the detected technology stack

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-simeshin/claude-code-hooks-mastery/main/install.sh | bash
```

Installs `.claude/` directory with refs, agents, hooks, and validators into the current project.

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Astral UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (auto-installed)

```bash
# Non-interactive install (for CI/Claude Code automation)
bash install.sh --force

# Custom options via env vars
TTS_ENABLED=y bash install.sh --force

# Uninstall
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-simeshin/claude-code-hooks-mastery/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

## Features

This fork extends [@disler](https://github.com/disler)'s original repository.

| Feature | What it does | vs Original | Docs |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Context Routing** | Keyword-based section routing — loads only relevant refs per task, zero LLM cost | Original loads all refs into context | [docs/context-routing.md](docs/context-routing.md) |
| **Plan With Team** | Two-round interview + Section Routing Catalog + Testing Strategy + 8-check validation | No structural validation in original | [docs/plan-w-team.md](docs/plan-w-team.md) |
| **Testing Strategy** | Enforced 80/15/5 test pyramid (unit / integration-API / UI e2e), dedicated `write-tests` task | Not in original | [docs/testing-strategy.md](docs/testing-strategy.md) |
| **Plan Review** | Two-stage gate before build: structural validator + 8-criteria Opus architect critic | Not in original | [docs/plan-review.md](docs/plan-review.md) |
| **Context7** | Optional live documentation lookup for any library via MCP | Not in original | [docs/context7.md](docs/context7.md) |
| **Serena** | Optional semantic code navigation via LSP — symbol search, references, type hierarchy | Not in original | [docs/serena.md](docs/serena.md) |
| **Validators** | Smart dispatcher runs matching validators per file extension (Java/React/Python) | Separate hooks per tool in original | [docs/validators.md](docs/validators.md) |
| **Status Line** | Recommends [claude-hud](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/claude-hud) — context bar, usage limits, tool/agent tracking, todos | Basic in original | [docs/status-line.md](docs/status-line.md) |
| **OpenSpec** | Optional living specs integration — explore existing specs, propose changes after plan review, track task progress during build | Not in original | [docs/openspec.md](docs/openspec.md) |
| **Install / Uninstall** | One-line `curl` install + non-interactive mode for CI/Claude Code | Manual setup in original | [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) |

## CLAUDE.md Coverage

This fork's flow **fully covers** the four behavioral guidelines from [andrej-karpathy-skills/CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) (Think Before Coding, Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, Goal-Driven Execution) — every section is enforced by an automated mechanism, not left to LLM discretion.

Compatible with any project that drops its own `CLAUDE.md` in the root: the `builder` agent reads it via `Glob("**/CLAUDE.md")` and merges it on top of these defaults.

| CLAUDE.md section | Enforced by | Strength |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| **§1 Think Before Coding** — assumptions, ambiguity, tradeoffs | `plan_w_team` Interview Round 1 + Round 2 (`AskUserQuestion`); plan-reviewer criteria #1 Problem Alignment, #3 Questions Gap | Strong — formalized gate |
| **§2 Simplicity First** — minimum code, no speculative abstractions | plan-reviewer criterion #5 Overengineering — explicit FAIL | Strong — gate |
| **§3 Surgical Changes** — touch only what's needed, no scope creep | plan-reviewer criterion #9 Surgical Scope (pre-build); `check_diff_scope.py` (post-build, compares git diff vs plan's Relevant Files) | Strong — gate + post-check |
| **§3 Match existing style** | Stack-aware refs auto-loaded by `context_router.py` (`refs/*-patterns.md`) + Context7 for live API docs | Strong |
| **§4 Goal-Driven Execution** — verifiable success criteria | `validate_plan.py` requires `## Acceptance Criteria`; `validator_dispatcher.py` runs ruff/ty/eslint/tsc/spotless on every Write/Edit | Strong — auto-enforced |

## MCP Integrations

### [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) (optional)

Live documentation lookup for any library. When available, builder and validator agents query Context7 before implementation to get current API references instead of relying on training data. Covers Spring Boot, React, FastAPI, and any other library. If not configured, agents fall back to refs and training data.

### [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) (optional)

Semantic code intelligence via Language Server Protocol. When available, all agents prefer Serena's symbol-level navigation (`find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `find_referencing_symbols`) over Glob/Grep for code exploration. Plan_w_team also uses Serena's `write_memory` / `read_memory` to persist architectural decisions across sessions. If Serena is not configured, agents fall back to Glob/Grep/Read.

### [OpenSpec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fission-ai/openspec) (optional)

Living specifications and delta tracking. When installed (`npm i -g @fission-ai/openspec && openspec init --tools claude`), it integrates into the pipeline at three points:

- **Explore** (plan_w_team Step 2) — reads existing specs via `openspec list/show` CLI to inform interview questions
- **Propose** (plan_w_team Step 13) — creates change artifacts (`openspec/changes/<name>/`) after plan review passes
- **Track** (smart_build Step 4) — marks completed tasks `[x]` in `tasks.md` incrementally, visible via `openspec view`

Post-build, use `/opsx:verify` and `/opsx:archive` (OpenSpec's own slash commands) to validate and finalize. If OpenSpec is not installed, all steps skip silently.

### [claude-hud](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/claude-hud) (recommended)

Rich status line for Claude Code — context window, usage rate limits, tool/agent tracking, todos, git status, and more. Install via Claude Code plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add jarrodwatts/claude-hud
/plugin install claude-hud
/claude-hud:setup
```

Configure display with `/claude-hud:configure` — choose layout (compact/expanded), toggle elements, customize colors.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan_w_team` | Create a plan with interviews, OpenSpec explore, plan review gate, and OpenSpec propose |
| `/smart_build` | Build with context routing + incremental OpenSpec task tracking |
| `/plan` | Quick single-agent implementation plan |
| `/all_tools` | List all available tools |
